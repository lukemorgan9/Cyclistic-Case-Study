# Cyclistic Case Study
## Introduction
The following case study on the fictional bike-share company Cyclistic was completed as my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. For this case study I used [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from the period of January 2024-January 2025. As Cyclistic is a fictional company with limited information provided on its operation via Coursera, I also used the Divvy website to aquire additional information about the bike sharing services offered including the types of rideables available, processes regarding using and docking the rideables and the terms of membership. For the purposes of my case study I applied this information to the fictional company Cyclistic.

Throughout my case study I will follow the six step data analysis process of: 
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyse
- Share
- Act

### Useful Links

During the case study I used SQL to process the data and Tableau to create compelling visualisations. I also created a presentation on Microsoft PowerPoint to convey my findings to stakeholders. The links to all of these are available below.

### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
