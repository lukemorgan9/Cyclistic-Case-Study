# Cyclistic Case Study
## Introduction
The following case study on the fictional bike-share company Cyclistic was completed as my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. For the purpose of this case study I used [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from the period of January 2024-January 2025. As Cyclistic is a fictional company with limited information provided on its operation via Coursera, I also used the Divvy website to aquire additional information about the bike sharing services offered including the types of rideables available, processes regarding using and docking the rideables and the benefits of membership. I then applied this information to my case study.

During the case study I used SQL to process the data and Tableau to create compelling visualisations.
